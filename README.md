## 📘 Business Context
Animal Society aims to create a **digital medical record system for domestic and non-domestic animals**, securely centralizing health information. The platform is designed to make data easily accessible to **veterinarians, pet owners, and healthcare facilities**, improving communication, continuity of care, and emergency management. It will comply with current **security and privacy standards** to protect sensitive data.

## ❗ Current Problems
Many veterinary clinics still rely on paper-based or poorly integrated digital systems. The main issues include:

- **📄 Incomplete Paper-Based Systems**  
  Long consultation times, fragmented data, and reduced effectiveness.

- **⚠️ Information Loss**  
  Difficulties in data sharing, risk of errors, and unnecessary repetition of exams.

- **🚫 Limited User Experience**  
  Non-intuitive interfaces, complicated data access, and poor operational efficiency.

## 🎯 Objectives

The web app aims to enhance the entire veterinary clinical management process:

- **🔍 Simplified Data Access**  
  Instant data sharing among stakeholders for more efficient and personalized care.

- **✅ Error Reduction**  
  Fewer duplications, misinterpretations, and data loss thanks to centralization.

- **✨ Intuitive User Experience**  
  A user-friendly interface accessible even to non-tech-savvy users.

## 👥 Key Stakeholders

- **👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Owners:**  
  Transparent and organized access to their pets' clinical data.

- **🐕 Patients (Animals):**  
  Secure and quickly accessible health information in any situation.
